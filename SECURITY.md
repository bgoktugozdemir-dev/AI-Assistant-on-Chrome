# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

The AI on Chrome Extension is designed with security and privacy as top priorities. This document outlines our security practices, privacy guarantees, and how to report security issues.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Local Processing Only
- **No Data Transmission**: All AI processing happens locally using Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano
- **No External APIs**: The extension never sends data to external servers
- **No Network Requests**: Zero network activity for AI functionality
- **Offline Capable**: Works completely offline once Chrome's AI model is downloaded

### Minimal Permissions
The extension requests only essential permissions:

- `activeTab`: Access current tab content for analysis
- `storage`: Store user preferences locally
- `scripting`: Inject content scripts for page interaction
- `host_permissions`: Access webpage content (processed locally only)

### Content Security
- **XSS Protection**: All user inputs are properly sanitized
- **Content Filtering**: Intelligent content extraction avoids malicious scripts
- **Safe Rendering**: Markdown rendering with XSS prevention
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing

### Code Security
- **Open Source**: Full source code available for security review
- **No Obfuscation**: All code is readable and auditable
- **No External Dependencies**: Minimal attack surface
- **Regular Updates**: Prompt security updates when needed

## üîê Privacy Guarantees

### Data Processing
- **Local Only**: All AI operations happen on your device
- **No Logging**: No user data is logged or stored remotely
- **No Analytics**: No tracking, analytics, or telemetry
- **No Profiling**: No user behavior analysis or profiling

### Data Storage
- **Local Storage Only**: Settings stored in Chrome's local storage
- **No Cloud Sync**: No data synchronization with external services
- **User Control**: Users can clear all data via Chrome settings
- **No Persistent Tracking**: No unique identifiers or tracking mechanisms

### Content Handling
- **Temporary Processing**: Page content is processed temporarily in memory
- **No Content Storage**: Webpage content is not stored permanently
- **Secure Extraction**: Content extraction respects page security policies
- **User Consent**: Content analysis only happens when user initiates it

## üö® Security Considerations

### Supported Environments
- **Chrome 138+**: Only works with supported Chrome versions
- **Secure Origins**: Respects Chrome's secure origin policies
- **Content Security Policy**: Compatible with strict CSP policies
- **Permission Model**: Follows Chrome's permission best practices

### Known Limitations
- **Content Extraction**: Some websites may block content extraction (by design)
- **AI Model Limitations**: Subject to Chrome's AI model constraints
- **Browser Security**: Relies on Chrome's security infrastructure
- **Local Device Security**: Security depends on device-level protections

## üîç Security Audit
